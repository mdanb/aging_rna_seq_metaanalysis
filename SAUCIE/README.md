The code in this folder was mostly taken directly from the [original SAUCIE repository](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/SAUCIE) and was migrated over from Tensorflow 1 to Tensorflow 2. 

To SAUCIE batch correct the data, run `python scripts/SAUCIE.py`

Then, to obtain a file with all the batch corrected data combined, run `python patch_together_data.py`
